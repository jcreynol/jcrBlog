  My name is **Cal Reynolds**, and I am a rising third year studying computer science at Hamilton College.  
 At Hamilton, I am a captain of the sailing team, participate on the varsity indoor and outdoor track and field teams, and am a member of the Campus Activities Board.
 Currently, I am in Cape Town, South Africa for the summer with iXperience studying data science and will begin interning at DataProphet next week. 
 This is my blog where I'll occasionally post my school and independent work.
